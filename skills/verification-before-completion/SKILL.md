# Verification Before Completion

## Overview

**Core principle:** Evidence before claims, always.

**Violating the letter of this rule is violating the spirit of this rule.**

## The Iron Law

```
NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE
```

If you haven't run the verification command in this message, you cannot claim it passes.

## The Gate Function

```
BEFORE claiming any status or expressing satisfaction:

1. IDENTIFY: What command proves this claim? (e.g. `flutter analyze`, `dart analyze`, or unit test)
2. DELEGATE TO FREE TASK SUBAGENT:
   - Primary agent (Luna) MUST NOT run heavy test/analyze commands directly (avoids bloating context).
   - Use `task` tool to instruct the `TASK` subagent (DeepSeek Flash - FREE) to run the command in background.
3. SUBAGENT RUNS & READS:
   - Task subagent executes the full verification command.
   - Reads full logs, checks exit code, and filters out noise.
   - Returns ONLY a concise 1-line verdict (e.g., "0 errors found" or "Error at line X: ...").
4. VERIFY: Does output confirm the claim?
   - If NO: Fix issues with minimal surgical edits.
   - If YES: Present claim WITH evidence.
5. ONLY THEN: Make the claim and let Judge approve.

Skip any step = lying, not verifying
```

## Common Failures

| Claim | Requires | Not Sufficient |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| Tests pass | Test command output: 0 failures | Previous run, "should pass" |
| Linter clean | Linter output: 0 errors | Partial check, extrapolation |
| Build succeeds | Build command: exit 0 | Linter passing, logs look good |
| Bug fixed | Test original symptom: passes | Code changed, assumed fixed |
| Regression test works | Red-green cycle verified | Test passes once |
| Agent completed | VCS diff shows changes | Agent reports "success" |
| Requirements met | Line-by-line checklist | Tests passing |

## Red Flags - STOP

- Using "should", "probably", "seems to"
- Expressing satisfaction before verification ("Great!", "Perfect!", "Done!", etc.)
- About to commit/push/PR without verification
- Trusting agent success reports
- Relying on partial verification
- Thinking "just this once"
- Tired and wanting work over
- **ANY wording implying success without having run verification**

## Rationalization Prevention

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Should work now" | RUN the verification |
| "I'm confident" | Confidence ≠ evidence |
| "Just this once" | No exceptions |
| "Linter passed" | Linter ≠ compiler |
| "Agent said success" | Verify independently |
| "I'm tired" | Exhaustion ≠ excuse |
| "Partial check is enough" | Partial proves nothing |
| "Different words so rule doesn't apply" | Spirit over letter |

## Key Patterns

**Tests:**
```
✅ [Run test command] [See: 34/34 pass] "All tests pass"
❌ "Should pass now" / "Looks correct"
```

**Regression tests (TDD Red-Green):**
```
✅ Write → Run (pass) → Revert fix → Run (MUST FAIL) → Restore → Run (pass)
❌ "I've written a regression test" (without red-green verification)
```

**Build:**
```
✅ [Run build] [See: exit 0] "Build passes"
❌ "Linter passed" (linter doesn't check compilation)
```

**Requirements:**
```
✅ Re-read plan → Create checklist → Verify each → Report gaps or completion
❌ "Tests pass, phase complete"
```

**Agent delegation:**
```
✅ Agent reports success → Check VCS diff → Verify changes → Report actual state
❌ Trust agent report
```

## Mandatory Completion Delivery Report (Prompt-Aligned)

BEFORE concluding the turn or declaring ANY task done, you MUST deliver your final response in this exact format:

### 📋 1. Yêu cầu ban đầu (User Goals):
- [Liệt kê chính xác từng gạch đầu dòng từ prompt gốc của user]

### ✅ 2. Những gì đã thực hiện:
- **[Mục 1]**: Giải thích ngắn gọn cách làm + file/hàm cụ thể đã sửa (`path/to/file.dart:line`).
- **[Mục 2]**: Giải thích ngắn gọn cách làm + file/hàm cụ thể đã sửa.

### 🔗 3. Những gì liên quan & Phạm vi ảnh hưởng (Side-effects):
- Các file/component phụ bắt buộc sửa theo để tránh gãy code (route, import, state).
- Tác động tới các màn hình khác trong project.

### 🧪 4. Kết quả kiểm tra (Verification Evidence):
- Lệnh verify đã chạy (`flutter analyze`, `ast-grep`, tests) kèm output: 0 errors, 0 warnings.

### 💡 5. Lưu ý từ Advisor (nếu có):
- Lưu ý kỹ thuật ngắn gọn (nếu có).

Violating this format is a direct violation of the Iron Law.
